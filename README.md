# Using Pandas to Handle Data with a PDF Base

This project demonstrates how to use Python's `pandas` library to extract, process, and handle data from PDF files. It is designed for scenarios where data is stored in a PDF format and needs to be converted into a structured format for analysis.

## Features

- Extracts tabular data from PDFs.
- Processes and cleans data using `pandas`.
- Handles multiple file formats.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Magalhaes-vitor/using-Pandas-to-handle-data-with-a-PDF-base.git
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Add your PDF file in the project directory.
2. Run the script to process the PDF and extract the data:

```bash
python extract_data.py
```

3. The extracted data will be saved as a CSV or other structured formats for further analysis.
